The arbitration is normally considered as a way of settling disputes outside of the court system.

In general, in a written contract, there are essentially two types of issues: enforceability and obligation. In order to become enforceable, the parties involved must prove some sort of breach of contract. Breach of contract is classified as partial if not complete, which implies that the parties only involved one specific party or the complete parties. In terms of obligations, when one party fails to fulfill its duties according to the terms of the contract, the other party is held responsible. When either party is liable to cause harm to one another, they stand guilty of causing actual damages. There are many factors that are considered to be necessary to prove an obligation, such as existence, conduct, damages, intent, and mutual consent.

Through proper dispute resolution, a company can avoid costly and prolonged legal battles as they can minimize costs and ensure that their commitments are fulfilled. Ultimately, the consequences of an incomplete contract can prove far more damaging than the initial miscommunication.\nIt is also possible for companies to be held accountable to stakeholders for their actions, decisions and activities.

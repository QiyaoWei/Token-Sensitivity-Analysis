When evaluating contracts and other contracts of representation, it is important that the terms are reasonable.

This agreement is governed by California law and any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration .\nTo determine the true meaning of contract terms, one needs to examine the language used. This means that, for instance, the phrase \u201d to undertake\u201d or \u201d to oblige\u201d does not always express a legally binding binding contract. For example, in a contract of assignment, a master often implies that he has the authority to perform his duties as the master of the assignment or \u201cassignor\u201d. In other words, to execute is not a legal term for a contract, unless the master is the one performing the assignment. Conversely, \u201d to do\u201d is not commonly used to mean any legally binding act or a formal document.

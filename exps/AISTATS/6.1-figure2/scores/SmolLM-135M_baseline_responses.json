If two businesses in a business environment have a failure of the same quality, they may decide to terminate each one. If each business decides to choose their own outcome, the final contract must specify whether the end point must be decided by either business or by a third party. To do this, the final agreement must identify the two parties. If both businesses agree that the trade-off that must be taken would be better for both companies, the third party need only specify which is what. An example of this might be if the two parties cannot agree on the end goal of the contract, this arrangement would mean they signed a contract that was never agreed upon. One way to resolve this situation would be to give each party a vote and determine the outcome.\n4."]
